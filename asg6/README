Project description:
  Created a Bullet HUD to go along with the original HUD from the last deliverable.
    Displays the free/thrown treat count. Treats can sit "on the ground" until a
    collision so thrown treats can last in the list for quite some time unlike
    a bullet might.

  Implemented projectiles (throwing treats) for the player class. I do need to
    update the player sprite as I just re-used the same sprite as the sprite I
    will be using for my smart sprites. Collision detection for treats and
    smart sprites is implemented. Currently my method for doing collision
    detection is not following OO standards, but I plan to fix this for the final
    deliverable by implementing a sprite manager to let me follow these standards
    more cleanly.

  On collision for treats and smart sprites, the smart sprite will explode. I do
    want to improve on the explosion as chunking doesn't look as good as I would
    like. After exploding the treat gets moved from the thrown treat list to
    the free list.

The easiest part of this project:
    Most aspects where fairly straight forward thanks to the examples. The bullet
    HUD was really easy since i could reuse the previous HUD from the last
    deliverable.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
    My biggest issue with this deliverable was that I did not manage my time very
    well with this project and other classes so I needed to push it back into
    the 3 day grace period. My code also really needs to be reformatted to
    follow OO standards better. A sprite manager would really help, and having
    classes inherit from Drawable would be much cleaner and easier to understand.
