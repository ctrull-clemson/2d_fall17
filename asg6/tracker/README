Project description:
  Final deliverable for the course.

  Since the last deliverable I have added unit
    collision between the player and the terrain/projectiles/smart sprites, with
    collisions between smart sprites and projectiles being kept from last time.

  The background and parallax layer have both been changed to new images. The
    foreground is quite large so the effect is not great but is noticeable.

  On game start the engine will create the grid of houses and the dogs to be
    rescued. It also randomly determines the "empty" houses that have blue
    lights instead of a yellow light. If the player collides with a blue window
    house after having rescued a dog it will decrement the saved dog count and
    flip the house.

  Background/Victory music has been added, and some game sound effects occur
    either when a requirement has been reached (bumping into a wall, returning
    a dog to its home, etc) or at a random time (dogs barking in the background).

  A third HUD, the game stat HUD, is located in the top right with information
    about how the player is doing in the game.

Game Goals:
  The goal of the game is for the player (Bowser) to help rescue all of the dogs
    that have managed to escape and are running around in the streets. You must
    make contact with the dog to "rescue" them, and then once you have rescued
    them you need to bring them back to an "empty" home (blue window, open gate).
    Your goal is to rescue the dogs in as fast a time as possible. The timer is
    located in the top right game stat HUD. Once all dogs are rescued the timer
    is stopped and turns blue. 

The easiest part of this project:
  Most of this deliverable was fairly straightforward. Some of the audio effects
    gave me trouble at first, but I think most of them have been straightened
    out now. I haven noticed a significant increase in crashes after adding
    sound, but it does not happen too often.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
  Nothing was extremely difficult, but there were problems with a few things.
    For audio I would sometimes crash when it would play a sound, but then then
    next time I run it I could have it happen 50 times safely. Recreating them
    in GDB was much more difficult too.

  Some of my player movements do still feel pretty shaky/could be improved on.
    Currently if a player bumps into an immobile object they just get told to go
    back the opposite direction. While it works, it does sometimes lead to
    interesting situations (if you get stuck on the far left between the border
    of the world and a house, the controls sometimes invert until you escape).
