Project description:
    Built a bullet HUD with information pertaining to the free/thrown list
    associated with the player. When you throw a treat it gets moved from the
    free to thrown list. After it explodes it gets added back to the free list.

The easiest part of this project:
    The bullet HUD took almost no time since I could re-use the code I had for
    the HUD that I made in a previous deliverable.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
    Finding time to work on the project. I didn't manage my time very well in
    the past few weeks so I had to push this off into the 3 day late grace
    period. Getting the basic features (hud, bullet list, exploding) were not
    too difficult, but finding the best way to do bullet collision detection
    was rough. I need to refactor my code pretty badly.
