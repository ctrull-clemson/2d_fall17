Project description:
  Implemented two way multiframe sprites, paralax scrolling, converted
  singletons, converted while/ranged for loops.

The easiest part of this project:
  Most of the project was fairly straight forward. Converting loops and
  singleton patterns took almost no time.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
  I was having issues with paralax scrolling because I forgot to make
  sure that the factor that was being read in was for the right background.
