Project description:
  Incorporated a player class with movement controls (traditional asdw keys).
    Space button will be implemented for projectiles in the next project.

  Built a HUD whos location can be changed via the XML. Defaults to top left
    of the screen. F1 can be pressed to toggle the HUD. All text on the HUD
    currently comes from within the code as controls are not changeable via the
    XML so it did not make sense to offer the ability to change the text on
    screen without a way to change the keybindings.

  Collision detection was brought in. Currently I have access to all 3 of the
    strategies that we covered in class and can change between them with 'm'.
    In the next project I plan to remove the option to switch between them and
    to set the strategies as I see appropriate for the various sprites.

  AI "Smart Sprites" have been added (currently 2, the horse and the dragon).
    These sprites will attempt to run away from the player whenever they get
    within a certain safe distance. Currently there is no additional effects if
    the player catches the AI, but in the next project I plan to make the Smart
    Sprites follow the player once they are "caught".

Game Level Description:
  For my game I am still working on developing what all I want my level to
    include. My current plan is to have a game that focuses on how fast the
    player can complete a task instead of having a shooter to see how enemies
    they can kill/beat/etc.

  The plan is to have the game spawn a number of immobile obstacles (dumb
    sprites with no move speed, just in the way to be in the way. Currently I am
    thinking houses and trees) based on information in the xml with a hard cap
    listed in the program itself. The players goal will to be to go around and
    "catch" all of the dogs (smart sprites) one at a time and bring them back to
    their house. For my bullet pool I plan on giving the player the ability to
    throw tennis balls to attract the dogs so they will chase the ball and be
    willing to get closer to the player. Any balls that do not attract the
    attention of a dog will sit on the ground, and the player can only get the
    balls added back to their bullet list by picking them up or by coming in
    contact with a dog who has picked up a ball.

  The game will end once all dogs have been returned to their homes. Depending
    on time and difficulty of implementation I will likely make it so each dog
    has a specified home, with bonus points being awarded based on how many
    throws the player needed, how long it took them, etc. I might implement an
    enemy AI dog catcher or something to make the player have to focus on dogs
    closer to the catcher instead of closer to them.

  For sprites most of the current sprites I am using will not be used for any
    of the upcoming projects. I will likely use the dog but besides that the
    rest don't make sense given the scope for the game I list out in the next
    section.

The easiest part of this project:
  Thanks to the various examples provided most aspects of this project were
    straight forward and easy to understand. It was a little unclear on what was
    expected for a "reconfigurable" HUD based solely on the paper.pdf
    description of the project.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
  I did not feel like anything with this project was overly difficult. I did
    need to spend some time going back and seeing what classes that derive from
    Drawable had which variables and getter functions.
