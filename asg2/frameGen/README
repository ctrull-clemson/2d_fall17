Project description:
  Create an image using SDL primitives, and overload at least one operator.

The easiest part of this project:
  Adding to the provided code to use the frame generator. After experimenting some
  with the different draw functions it was not to difficult to manipulate them as
  I needed. Drawing the black horizontal lines took a little work to make sure
  they didn't exceed the outer circle that was already drawn.


Problems that I had in completing this project:
  Getting the overload operator to work. I was not putting the overload prototype
  in my pokeball.h file so I was getting errors related to << for my class not
  being defined.

  I also did not have time to implement drawing different types of pokeballs
  like I had wanted to. That was the main purpose of the BALL_ID in the
  Pokeball class.
